### Preparing HRR

To start using Haskell Relational Record (HRR), you need to install:

- Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) + the "cabal" command
-- We recommend to use Haskell Platform
- The Haskell "relational-record" library
- Relational database system
-- In this quickstart, we assume that "sqlite3" has been installed

To install the Haskell "relational-record" library, type as follows:

    % cabal update
    % cabal install relational-record
